# SpringCard (public) .NET libraries

This repository stores all the .NET libraries that are referenced by SpringCard's SDK and related software.

## Available libraries

### Bluetooth

A library to access BLE devices from a WPF application.

### PC/SC Helpers

Various libraries to work with smart cards.

### PC/SC

Winscard wrapper for .NET. Gives access to PC/SC readers and smart cards. 

### Utils

### Windows

## Target platforms

All the libraries target .NET Framework 4.8 (`net48`).

Some of the libraries target the .NET Core 6 (`net60`) as well.

## Building the libraries

## Net48 targets

Every library comes with its project for the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (.sln and .csproj) in a subdirectory named `net48`.

Projects have been created with Visual Studio 2017, then updated with Visual Studio 2019, and finally have updated with Visual Studio 2022.

Building from the command line is easy using `MSBUILD.EXE`. Use the `BUILD-NET48.CMD` file at the root to build all the projects in a row.

### Net60 targets

Every library comes with its project for the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (.sln and .csproj) in a subdirectory named `net60`.

Projects have been created with Visual Studio 2022.

Building from the command line is easy using `DOTNET.EXE`. Use the `BUILD-NET60.CMD` file at the root to build all the projects in a row.

## Obtaining pre-compiled binaries

Most customers will prefer using pre-compiled binaries instead of having to build the libraries themselves.

Pre-compiled binaries are regularly released on [github.com/springcard/springcard-dotnet-libraries/releases](https://github.com/springcard/springcard-dotnet-libraries/releases).

Alternatively, the binaries could easily be found in the installation directory of the software that use them, namely the [SpringCard PC/SC QuickStart package](https://www.springcard.com/en/download/find/file/sq13163) and the [SpringCard SpringCore Tools set](https://www.springcard.com/fr/download/find/file/sq20029).

## Documentation

All the libraries are self-documented using Doxygen.

Official documentation is published by SpringCard on [docs.springcard.com/](https://docs.springcard.com/).
